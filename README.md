## Adhoc Workflow Voters v1
### Purpose
- Alows Administrators to graphically view the data model of an ItemType with all its Relationships, related Items Types and Item Property links.
- This solution is targeted for Aras Innovator Administrators only.

### Pre-requisites
Aras Innovator Release: 12SP5


### Implementation Details
- Two new Actions are introduced on Item Type **Item Type**
- Each starts a different Graph View  based on a different Query Definition
	- Graph View: **Innovator Data Model Down** will resolve relationships to other Item Types recursively. And it will also resolve all item Property to their target Item Types.
	- Graph View: **Innovator Data Model Surround** (360Â°) will resolve relationships to other Item Types one level down and one level up (where used).  And it will also resolve all item Property to their target Item Types and item Properties pointing to this Item Type with their source Item Types.

- From the Graph View the displayed ItemTypes, Relationships, and Item Properties can be opened using right click action **Open Item**.
- If on an ItemType block, another right click action **Open Graph View** allows to start this GraphView again starting with the selected ItemType.


### Improvements
- Add resolution of LifeCycles and Workflows to show on ItemTypes.
